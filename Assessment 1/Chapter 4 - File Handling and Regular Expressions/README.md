# Python Skills Portfolio Assessment Solutions

This repository showcases my solutions to a set of Python programming exercises as part of a skills portfolio assessment. The exercises cover diverse topics, including user input and output, mathematical calculations, conditional statements, loops, and data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

I successfully implemented solutions for each exercise, demonstrating proficiency in various aspects of Python programming. The code is organized into separate files for each exercise, making it easy to review and understand.

Feel free to explore the repository and assess the code for a comprehensive overview of my Python programming skills.
